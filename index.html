<p>‘Jhola’ is a Nepali film based on 
Krishna Dharawasi’s short story “Jhola”.
It has depicted Nepali society about the
Sati tradition that was prevalent until 
the 1920s. The film has beautifully 
presented the issues of violence against 
women. “Has Nepalese society really passed 
through such inhuman tradition?” is the 
question every youngster wonders about.

The plot develops with the death of 
Garima’s husband in which she has to 
immolate herself upon her husband’s death, 
typically on his funeral pyre. She is 
supposed to be burnt alive with the dead 
body of her husband according to the 
tradition. However, she escapes the fire 
and hides in a cave. The help of her son 
fascinates the audience.

Almost all the scenes seem realistic and 
historical. Traditional tools like dhiki, 
janto, madaani, etc. give a traditional 
look to the film. Similarly, traditional 
lights like ranko, diyalo and fire place 
represent ancient environment to the 
spectators. In addition to Sati tradition, 
the movie also touches Kamara Kamari 
(a kind of slavery) tradition. What a 
beautiful cinematography it is! I think 
costumes of the artists and the leaf music 
in traditional tunes touch the heart of 
every one present in the cinema hall. 
Garima’s natural appearance, her role and 
her acting are spellbinding and add to the 
beauty of the movie.
